## Docker

​		Docker is an open platform for developing,shipping,and running applications. Docker enables 	you to separate your applications from your infrastructure. Docker provides ability to package and run application in loosely isolated environment called container. 

The isolation and security allow you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. This means you can run more containers on a given hardware.

## What can I use Docker for?

### Fast, consistent delivery of your applications:

​	Docker streamlines the development life cycle by allowing developers to work in standardized environments using local containers which provide your applications and services. Containers are great for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) workflows.

Consider the following example scenario:

- Your developers write code locally and share their work with their colleagues using Docker containers.
- They use Docker to push their applications into a test environment and execute automated and manual tests.
- When developers find bugs, they can fix them in the development environment and redeploy them to the test environment for testing and validation.
- When testing is complete, getting the fix to the customer is as simple as pushing the updated image to the production environment.

### Responsive deployment and scaling:

​	Docker ’s container-based platform allows for highly portable workloads. Docker containers can run on a developer’s local laptop, on physical or virtual machines in a data center, on cloud providers, or in a mixture of environments.

Docker ’s portability and lightweight nature also make it easy to dynamically manage workloads, scaling up or tearing down applications and services as business needs dictate, in near real time.

### Running more workloads on the same hardware:

​	Docker is lightweight and fast. It provides a viable, cost-effective alternative to hyper visor-based virtual machines, so you can use more of your compute capacity to achieve your business goals. Docker is perfect for high density environments and for small and medium deployments where you need to do more with fewer resources.
